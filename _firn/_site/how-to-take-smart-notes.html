Make </span><a class="firn-internal" href="https://notes.yosevu.com/note-taking">note-taking</a><span> more natural and productive. Writing is not a linear process. "It does not follow learning, research or study, it is the medium of each" (Ahrens). Bad note-taking is common because it has a poor feedback loop. The feedback loop is poor because there isn't a mechanism to connect notes to a purpose. There isn't a </span><a class="firn-internal" href="https://notes.yosevu.com/private/negative-feedback-loops">negative feedback loop</a><span> that can be used to learn from to take better notes. With smart notes, the quality and flow of writing depends on what has already been written. The quality of that writing is a </span><a class="firn-internal" href="https://notes.yosevu.com/private/habits">habit</a><span> and effective note-taking is a habit that </span><a class="firn-internal" href="https://notes.yosevu.com/private/compounding-knowledge">compounds knowledge</a><span>.

It is not </span><em><span>having willpower</span></em><span>, but </span><em><span>not having to use willpower</span></em><span> that indicates that you set yourself up for success. (Ahrens).
