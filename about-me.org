* About me

Hello, I'm Yosevu Kilonzo. I'm a developer. I build things for the web at [[https://seesparkbox.com/][Sparkbox]].

I have experience working on small and large full-stack projects with modern HTML, CSS, JavaScript, as well as other tools and technologies. I'm particularly interested in Functional Programming, Clojure, and [[file:integral-software.org][Integral Software]].

I'm also interested in the relationship between writing and thinking as well as the ideas, systems, and tools for better thinking and insight.

I value communication through connection, questions over answers, dialogue over narrative, thought before action, process over product, and [[file:solving-the-right-problem.org][solving the right problem]].
