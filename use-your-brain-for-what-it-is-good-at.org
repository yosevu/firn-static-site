Humans are good at thinking, computers are good at computing.

Thinking is not an analog for computing. [[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/computing#English][Computing]] is the process of [[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/calculate#English][calculation]] to determine the value solution to a problem. It uses a specific mathematical process. In contrast, [[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/think#English][to think]], is to wonder, to ponder, and to conceive. It is a more general phenomenon than computing and requires a human-like consciousness. We can use thinking for mechanical and repetitive tasks in computing, mathematics and other domains, but humans gravitate toward the kind of thinking that is characterized by making non-linear connections, pattern recognition, and creative insight.
