Humans are good at thinking, computers are good at computing.

Thinking is not an analog to computing. [[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/computing#English][Computing]] is the process of [[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/calculate#English][calculation]] to determine the value solution to a problem. It uses a specific mathematical process. In contrast, to [[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/think#English][think]] is to wonder and to ponder deeply. It is a more general phenomenon than computing and requires a human-like consciousness. Thinking can be used for repetitive, mechanical tasks in computing, mathematics and other domains, but humans gravitate toward the kind of thinking that is characterized by non-linear connections, pattern recognition, and creative insight.
