Hello, I'm [[file:about-me.org][Yosevu Kilonzo]]. These are my notes, written with [[https://www.orgroam.com/][Org-roam]] in [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]], published with [[https://firn.theiceshelf.com/][Firn]], and inspired by [[https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes][Andy's working notes]]. You can find the source code [[https://github.com/yosevu/notes.yosevu.com][here]].

I use the [[file:zettelkasten.org][Zettelkasten]] note-taking system, popularized by the German sociologist [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann][Niklas Luhmann]] and the book [[file:how-to-take-smart-notes.org][How to Take Smart Notes]] by SÃ¶nke Ahrens. /Zettelkasten/ is usually translated as /slip box/, "slip" in the sense of a small piece of paper, a note.

The core idea is to [[file:use-your-brain-for-what-it-is-good-at.org][use your brain for what it is good at]].

Human brains are good at recognizing patterns, making connections, and creative insight. Computers and systems are better suited for organizing, remembering, and managing information. [[file:writing-is-a-fundamental-tool-for-thought.org][Writing is a fundamental tool for thought]] and the slip box is a system that allows you to use you brain for the type of thinking it is good at.

This is my slip box. This is where I write. This is where I think.

Let me know what you think!
