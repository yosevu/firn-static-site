* Books
- Review notes after each chapter and summarize before beginning the next.
- Review chapter summaries halfway through the book and begin book summary.
- Review review remaining chapter summaries and complete book summary.
- Publish book summary.
* How I Use Backlinks
- I use general categories like "Books" "Thinking" "Problem Solving" as collection pages to collect references to the specific contexts that the concepts are relevant.
- I also link these general concepts in list pages like Bookmarks, and Tools so that information that I can also find information that I haven't process in the contexts I will likely need it.

THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER A LAZY DOG.

* Emphasis Rules for [[file:private/progressive-summarization.org][Progressive Summarization]]
Base emphasis on resonance. Limit to two categories for simplicity: resonance and high resonance.

** Books

- Use yellow for resonance, unfamiliar, did not understand etc.
- Use a secondary color for high resonance, key ideas.

** Notes

- _Use bold for resonance_
- *Use underline for high resonance*
